		Imagine you are a researcher studying whether engaging in different routines at the start of the day can improve peopleâ€™s moods. Here are some examples of these routines:
		</p>
		<div class="pgdvsmall" style="height:auto;">
			<img src="/static/pictures/cycling.jpg" height=160px position:relative display:inline></img>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			<img src="/static/pictures/yoga.jpg" height=160px position:relative display:inline></img>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			<img src="/static/pictures/climbing.jpg" height=160px position:relative display:inline></img>
		</div>					
		<p>
		You recruit a group of volunteers. Each volunteer is instructed in an easy-to-follow routine involving an assigned activity (e.g. yoga, cycling, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
		They are told to try the routine involving the assigned activity some mornings instead of their regular morning routines. Each volunteer has a different regular routine (e.g. running, reading a book, etc.). At the end of the day, they report to you whether they were in a good mood or not that day.
